# NLP Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of  Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects built for learning and practice purposes.  
Each folder inside represents a separate project that implements different NLP concepts using Python and Machine Learning.

# About the Repository
While learning NLP and text-based Machine Learning, I wanted to apply the concepts in a practical way.  
This repo is a collection of those implementations — from sentiment analysis to spam detection and more — focusing on turning theory into working models.

# Purpose :
The goal of this repository is to practice and strengthen NLP and ML concepts through hands-on coding.
